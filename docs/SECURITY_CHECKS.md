### BR-24: Automated Reasoning Policy Implementation

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Checks if Automated Reasoning policies are configured on guardrails for formal verification of model responses.

## Financial Services GenAI Risk Checks (64 additional, 5 upstream extensions)

These 64 standalone checks (FS-XX) extend the framework with Financial Services
risk-management controls derived from the
[AWS User Guide to Governance, Risk, and Compliance for Responsible AI Adoption](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-the-updated-aws-user-guide-to-governance-risk-and-compliance-for-responsible-ai-adoption/).
An additional 5 FS checks are contributed as extensions to existing SM-07,
SM-22, SM-23, BR-04, and BR-06 (see in-file extension notes).

The full catalog is in **[`SECURITY_CHECKS_FINSERV.md`](./SECURITY_CHECKS_FINSERV.md)**,
organized into three parts:

- **Part 1 — Infrastructure & Resource Controls** — FS-01 to FS-26
  (Unbounded Consumption, Excessive Agency, Supply Chain, Training Poisoning, Vector
  Weaknesses).
- **Part 2 — Guardrails & Content Safety** — FS-27 to FS-46
  (Non-Compliant Output, Misinformation, Abusive/Harmful Output, Biased Output,
  Sensitive Information Disclosure).
- **Part 3 — Application-Layer Controls & Material Gaps** — FS-47 to FS-69
  (Hallucination, Prompt Injection, Improper Output Handling, Off-Topic Output,
  Out-of-Date Training Data, and 6 cross-category material gap checks).

The same document includes the shared intro, severity rubric, validation note,
upstream-overlap table, and the compliance framework mapping table
(SR 11-7, FFIEC CAT, NYDFS 500.06, PCI-DSS 12.3.2, DORA Art.6, MAS TRM 9,
ISO 27001 A.12, ECOA, OWASP LLM Top 10).
